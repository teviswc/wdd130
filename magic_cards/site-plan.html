        Do you love fantasy, wizards, and magic? Do you like collecting, meeting new people and playing games that require a lot of strategy? Well then you have come to the right place. Let me introduce you to Magic the Gathering a game that was released to the public 30 years ago this year in 1993. 
        The most fun you can have with Magic is with playing and competing with others. The game has many formats in which to play. From Modern to Commander, Pioneer, Historic and others. Each has their own set of rules. But the basic rules are the same for every format. Learn the basics of how to play or where you can learn more about the 5 different elements or colors in Magic.

      <h3>Learn the Basics</h3>
      <p>
        The video above will tell you how to play a card in a game which is a great way to get started. Please watch this before moving forward. Not included in the video is the turn structure. 

        Begin 

        Untap creatures and lands: When you use a land to play a spell, creature, etc you turn it sideways. This is called tapping it. The same applies for a creature, If you attack an opponent with a creature you also tap at. These cannot be used again until the start of your turn when you turn them back vertically. This is called untapping 

        Draw a card: Draw one card from your deck and put it into your hand. (The game is started with 7 cards) 

        Main Phase 

        Play a land (Only one per turn): From your hand you may play a land as stated in the video these fuel your spells and creature cards 

        Cast Creatures and/or Sorceries: Pay the cost for your card play it on the field. These can be creatures or spells, Sorceries can only be played on your turn. There's another spell type called an Instant which can be played anytime during anyone's turn as long as you have mana(land) to play it.  

        Combat 

        Declare Attackers: You announce to your opponents which creatures are attacking and you tap them (see above for explanation on tapping and untapping) If there are many opponents make sure to tell who is attacking and who. 

        Your Opponent(s) Declare Blockers: In Magic you cannot target a specific creature unless a card has instructions to do so, your opponents decide which of their creatures will block the creatures you are using to attack. 

        Combat Damage is Dealt: Each card on the bottom right corner has a power and toughness rating. An example would be 2/1. 2 being the power of the card and 1 being how much power it can withstand. You put your cards power against your opponent's cards toughness. 

        Main Phase (again) 

        Play a land (If you haven't already): You get two main phases, you can decide to play your land now if you haven't already.  

        Cast Creatures and/or Sorceries: If you have things you want to do after combat you can decide to play the cards now. 

        End 

        Your Creatures Heal: If your toughness is not dropped to zero in your turn, your creatures go back up to the full number on the card. 

        Pass the turn to your opponent

      <h3>Other Information</h3>
      <p>
        Magic has many things to offer if you are planning on joining the vast number of players that play and collect cards. You can collect cards just to trade with others as each card is labelled with its rarity and there are many websites that list how much a card is worth if you plan on selling.  Many local game stores have a Magic scene and if you are into trading or buying cards or even complete premade decks, you can find a lot of opportunities there.
