    <h2>Tevis Carpenter</h2>
    <p>I am planning on getting a degree in web and software programming.</p>
    <p>I love video games. Especially the Legend of Zelda series.
I have played video games since I was a kid. I also love listening to audiobooks and studying history in my spare time</p>
    <p>I have been married for 3 years. I have 4 children, 3 teenage boys and a one year old girl. My family means everything to me.</p>
    <p>I was born in the covenant. I served my mission from 2008 to 2011 in the Charlotte North Carolina mission. 
I am very happy they are getting a new temple soon.</p>
